parameters :
    sampleset_id :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq SampleSet or Read Library
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNASeqSampleSet or ReadsSet object. If you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.
    assembly_or_genome_id :
        ui-name : |
            Assembly or Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the Assembly or Genome to align the reads.
    alignmentset_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Set Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix that will be appended to the name of the output alignment set.
    alignment_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix that will be appended to the name of the output alignment.
    quality_score :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Quality Score Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the quality score type used to generate the reads (phred33 is used by Illumina starting with v1.8).
    skip :
        ui-name : |
            Skip the first N reads or pairs in the input
        short-hint : |
            During alignment, skip the first N reads or pairs in the input.
    trim5 :
        ui-name : |
            Trim Bases From 5'end
        short-hint : |
            The number of bases to trim from the 5' (left) end of each read before alignment (default is 0).
    trim3 :
        ui-name : |
            Trim Bases From 3'end
        short-hint : |
            The number of bases to trim from the 3' (right) end of each read before alignment (default is 0).
    np :
        ui-name : |
            Penalty
        short-hint : |
            Sets the penalty for positions where the read, reference, or both, contain an ambiguous character such as N (default is 1).
    min_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            HISAT2 will ignore donor/acceptor pairs closer than this many bases apart.
    max_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            HISAT2 will ignore donor/acceptor pairs farther than this many bases apart.
    no_spliced_alignment :
        ui-name : |
            Disable Splice Alignment
        short-hint : |
            HISAT2 will disable splice alignment.
    orientation :
        ui-name : |
            Orientation
        short-hint : |
            Select the upstream/downstream mate orientations for a valid paired-end alignment against the forward reference strand (default is fr).
    reads_condition :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Reads Condition
        short-hint : |
            Set the condition for the reads input. Ignore if using a set of multiple samples.

    <p>This App aligns the sequencing reads from a read library or a sample set of reads to long reference sequences of an assembly or a genome using HISAT2 and outputs a corresponding alignment (set) in BAM format.</p>

    <p>In addition, it outputs the Qualimap-generated BAM QC report for the alignment (set) which includes a global and individual sample-wise summary of number of mapped reads, coverage, GC-content, mapping quality, etc. in tabular format, and various plots such as PCA and coverage histograms to visualize the tabular data.</p>

    <p>HISAT2 is essentially a successor of TopHat2, and it is relatively faster and more sensitive while still maintaining low memory requirements. The HISAT2 index is based on the FM Index of Ferragina and Manzini, which in turn is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The algorithm used to build the index is based on the blockwise algorithm of Karkkainen.</p>

    <p><strong>Team members who implemented algorithm in KBase:</strong> Srividya Ramakrishnan, Sunita Kumari, Shinjae Yoo, Priya Ranjan, Jim Thomason, and Vivek Kumar. For questions, please <a href="http://kbase.us/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p>
